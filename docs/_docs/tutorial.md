# Tutorial

Here you'll find multiple examples that also work as a tutorial to get started with Minart. It is recommended to follow them in order.

If you would like to run some of them, all the examples are available in [the examples directory](https://github.com/JD557/minart/tree/master/examples).
Just follow the instructions to run them with [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/).
