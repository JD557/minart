<h1>Minart</h1>

<p>
  Minart is a minimal Scala library for multimedia applications, such as generative art or simple video games.
</p>

<p>
  It's based on a few simple principles:

  <ol>
    <li>Simple things should be simple, complex things can be complex
      <ul>
        <li>It should be easier to put a pixel on the screen than to draw an image</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Platform agnostic abstractions vs platform specific optimizations
      <ul>
        <li>The code should cross-compile between JVM/JS/Native with the minimum number of changes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Minart is still in a 0.x version. Quoting the semver specification:
  <blockquote>
    Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
  </blockquote>
</p>
