<h1>Minart</h1>

<h2>What is Minart?</h2>
<p>
  Minart is a minimal Scala library for multimedia applications, such as generative art or simple video games.
</p>

<p>
  It's based on a few simple principles:

  <ol>
    <li>Simple things should be simple, complex things can be complex
      <ul>
        <li>It should be easier to put a pixel on the screen than to draw an image</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Platform agnostic abstractions vs platform specific optimizations
      <ul>
        <li>The code should cross-compile between JVM/JS/Native with the minimum number of changes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Development status</h2>
<p>
  Minart is still in a <strong>0.x version</strong>. Quoting the semver specification:
  <blockquote>
    Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
  </blockquote>

  As such, while it's OK to use minart for small demos, it's not recommended to use it for commercial projects.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
  Due to the design pricinples of Minart, it will never achieve the performance of dedicated libraries.
</p>
<p>
  As such, while Minart can be used to develop video games, if performance
  becomes an issue it might be worth looking into dedicated game engines, such
  as <a href="https://indigoengine.io">Indigo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, Minart is only suitable for bitmap graphics.
  For vector graphics it is recommended to use an appropriate library, such
  as <a href="https://www.creativescala.org/doodle/">Doodle</a>.
