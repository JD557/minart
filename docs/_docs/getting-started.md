# Getting Started

To include Minart, simply add the `minart` library to your project:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "eu.joaocosta" %% "minart" % "{{ projectVersion }}"
```

Or just create a new project using the provided [giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) template, with:

```
g8 https://github.com/JD557/minart
```

## Tutorial

The easiest way to start using the library is to follow the tutorials in the [`examples`](https://github.com/JD557/minart/tree/master/examples) directory.

The examples in [`examples/release`](https://github.com/JD557/minart/tree/master/examples/release) target the latest released version,
while the examples in [`examples/snapshot`](https://github.com/JD557/minart/tree/master/examples/snapshot) target the code in the repository.

All the examples are `.sc` files that can be executed via [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/).
