# Minart Examples

Here you'll find multiple examples that also work as a tutorial to get started with Minart.

Each example is prefixed by a number, which indicate the recommended order for each lesson.

To run an example, you can use [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/).
For instance, to run the first example, just run `scala-cli 01-color-square.sc`.

The examples in `examples/release` target the latest released version, while the examples in `examples/snapshot` target
the code in the repository. If you are starting out, it is recommended that you look at the examples in the `release`
directory.
